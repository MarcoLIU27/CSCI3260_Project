# Manipulation:
### Key "Esc": exit
### Move mouse to left: Rotate the spacecraft anti-clockwisely
### Move mouse to right: Rotate the spacecraft clockwisely
### Up arrow key: move the spacecraft forward
### Down arrow key: move the spacecraft backward
### Left arrow key: move the spacecraft to the left
### Right arrow key: move the spacecraft to the right
### W key: increase the light tensity
### S key:   decrease the light tensity
### P key: turn on/off the point light
### A key: accelerate the crafts
### D key: decelerate the cratfs
### R key: increase the fov
### F key : decrease the fov

### Object: planet, spacecraft, satellite, allienperson, craft,rock
## Interesting interaction: 
### 1)when spacecraft flew close to the craft, the craft's texture will change
### 2)we can speed up/down the crafts by press A/D
### 3)the crafts will continuely run in horizon axis. After they pass the spacecraft, they will appear again.
