# Manipulation:

### Key "Esc": exit

### Click mouse left button: Rotate the spacecraft anti-clockwise

### Click mouse right button: Rotate the spacecraft clockwise

### Up arrow key: move the spacecraft forward

### Down arrow key: move the spacecraft backward

### Left arrow key: move the spacecraft to the left

### Right arrow key: move the spacecraft to the right

### W key: increase the directional light intensity

### S key: decrease the directional light intensity

### P key: turn on/off the point light (default turn off)

### A key: accelerate the crafts

### D key: decelerate the crafts

### Objects: planet, spacecraft, **satellites**, **alien**, crafts, rocks

## Additional light: a directional light, can use W/S to change its intensity

## Interesting interaction: 

### 1) when spacecraft flies close to the craft, the craft's texture will change

### 2) you can speed up/down the crafts by pressing A/D

### 3) the crafts will continually run along horizon axis. After they pass the spacecraft, they will appear again
